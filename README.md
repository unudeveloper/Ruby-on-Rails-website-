# Coolio (Beta)

Coolio is an e-commerce Ruby on Rails & Graphql powered backend. It also includes an admin frontend that you can use as a reference when you create your own e-commerce site. It uses JWT for authentication.

With Coolio you can create your own e-commerce site with Gatsby, Sapper, Nuxt, Gridsome... you name it. And because it's Graphql powered it's very easy for you to use only what you need.

Coolio includes an admin example site made with Svelte JS and Apollo client. It uses TailwindCss for layout and styling.
